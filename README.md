# RaspberryJAMMA

RaspberryJAMMA is a project focused on adding JAMMA controls to Raspbian
This will be achieved by incorporating the hard work performed by Jochen at ArcadeForge and his Pi2JAMMA hardware as well as his toolset incorporating JAMMA controls into Raspbian

# What about JAMMA video?!

JAMMA video is already supported by my other project, https://github.com/xovox/RetroCRT

# Why another project?

This project's main goal is to be a stand-alone JAMMA controls suite that can be installed independently of any video controls.
I prefer this modular approach as it's easier to manage and makes my goal of having it integrated into RetroPie's optional packages more attainable.
I'm also aiming to pull in other developers so they're not all running their own JAMMA controls in separate RetroPie spins and we can all collaborate together.
